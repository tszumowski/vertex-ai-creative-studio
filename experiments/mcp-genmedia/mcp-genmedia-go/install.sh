# This script provides a convenient way to install or upgrade the Go MCP servers
# in this project. It performs the following actions:
#
# 1. Discovers all available MCP servers (directories matching 'mcp-*-go').
# 2. Checks if Go is installed and provides instructions if it is not.
# 3. Checks if the user's PATH includes the Go binary directory and provides
#    instructions on how to add it if it is missing.
# 4. Presents an interactive menu to install a specific server or all of them.
# 5. Compiles and installs the selected server(s) using 'go install'.
