Using Gemini-TTS, you can synthesize speech from short snippets to long-form narratives, precisely dictating style, accent, pace, tone, and even emotional expression, all steerable through natural-language prompts.\n\n[Learn more about Gemini-TTS on Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/gemini-tts)",
